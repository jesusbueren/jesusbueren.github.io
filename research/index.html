	<h3>Long-Term Care Needs and Savings in Retirement</h3>  [PDF] (Submitted)
	<p>Contrary to predictions of standard life cycle models, individuals dissave slowly during retirement.
	I investigate the role of long-term care (LTC) needs in the saving decisions of the elderly and 
	quantify its importance relative to bequest motives. For this purpose, I develop and estimate a model
	for retired single individuals who are heterogeneous in their access to informal care and make an optimal
	choice of care hours bought in the market. In order to take into account heterogeneity in both LTC needs and
	survival probabilities, I model LTC needs using a dynamic latent variable model that summarizes the rich information
	contained in health surveys into four parsimonious health groups. I find that a model featuring heterogeneity in LTC
	needs where LTC expenses are endogenous is able to reproduce both large spending propensities when indivuals are in most
	need and is consistent with strong bequest motives at the top of the wealth distribution. Counterfactual simulations show
	that both bequest and LTC needs are important drivers of savings for the old but LTC needs are quantitatively more important. </p>
